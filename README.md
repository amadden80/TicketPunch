This project was designed to give both groups a chance to share their knowledge of their respective crafts, and come up with a great design for an app that allows you to create your own personalized list of movies-to-watch.

We were given the theme of "Playful," our collaboration on design naturally coalesced around the theme of Bouncing Balls!!!

On this page, you can search our vast movie database by movie title. Each search will return the movie's Title, Director, Year, and a Plot Summary.

If you want to watch that movie, you can add it to your Watch List. If you change your mind later, you can always click Remove to ... well ... delete it from the list.

This collaboration is a work in progress and version 2 will more fully reflect the following splendid, radiant, awe-inspiring wireframes, created by our ab-fab designers.
